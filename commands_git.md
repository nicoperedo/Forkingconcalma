# Commands from Git

### Basic routine for commiting

That is how I save a snaptshot/point in time
Add together files that you want to commit together.
```
git add <name of the file>
git commit -m "meaninful msg"
```

### Check the status of my files and directories

Check if they are uncommited, unstaged or untracked

`git status`

if you restore, you will delete your cheges!!!
